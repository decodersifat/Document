# Admin Approval Endpoints

This document lists API endpoints used by Admins (and Hub Managers where noted) to approve or reject merchants, documents, stores, riders, transfer records, and delivery verification requests.

All endpoints below are protected and require an admin JWT (Bearer token). The `Roles` guard is used to limit access — see each endpoint for required roles.

If you want, I can:
- Add explicit `reject document` endpoints for merchant documents (server currently lacks those), or
- Generate OpenAPI snippets for these routes.
